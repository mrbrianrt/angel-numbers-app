    <h1>888 or 8888</h1>

    <p>
      One of the most divine numbers in numerology is eight, and observing this
      digit as an angel number (either within a set of three, four, or within a
      pattern) could reflect a connection to the spiritual universe in a
      powerful way. Those who believe in an afterlife may see eights as a sign
      that they're receiving supernatural support from loved ones who've crossed
      on. Fundamentally, eight is the symbol of infinity — the endless loop that
      transcends any singular lifetime — so don't be afraid to dive into your
      intuition when this angel number appears.
