      Three is an indication of magnetic creativity. Noticing three as an angel
      number (either within a set of three, four, or within a pattern) could
      mean that you have the opportunity to add your unique talents and
      abilities to a situation. Moreover, the presence of three indicates that
      by leaning into your innate gifts, you'll find more value and abundance in
      whatever circumstances you are navigating. Your artistic expression is
      critical!
