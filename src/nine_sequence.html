    <h1>999 or 9999</h1>

    <p>
      As the final digit in numerology, the presence of nine suggests a chapter
      may be coming to an end. Witnessing nine as an angel number (either within
      a set of three, four, or within a pattern) is sign that a meaningful cycle
      could come to a close, and you'll soon be beginning a brand new journey.
      Likewise, this is an excellent time to step outside your comfort zone,
      expand your horizons, and explore new territory. Whether you're interested
      in venturing into a new career or going back to school, the spiritual
      universe will be sure to support your courageous choices.
