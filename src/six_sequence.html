    <h1>666 or 6666</h1>

    <p>
      Although some may fear six (especially in a triplet) because of religious
      associations with the Devil or demon figures, within angel numbers, six
      (either within a set of three, four, or within a pattern) has a
      supportive, compassionate, and empathetic nature. Six can be a gentle,
      much-needed reminder to treat yourself with kindness and understanding.
      Sure, things may not always go according to plan, but with angel number
      six on your side, you know that you can choose how you want to interpret a
      situation, remembering that everything happens for a reason.
