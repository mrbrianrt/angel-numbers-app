    <p>
      One is a powerful manifestation figure. If you encounter one as an angel
      number (either within a set of three, four, or within a pattern), relish
      the opportunity to make a wish, set an intention, or plant a seed, as this
      is believed to indicate a "greenlight" from the universe. You are working
      with extraordinary support from your angels, guides, or ancestors, so — at
      that moment — the present and future are dynamically connected.
